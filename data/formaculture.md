At Formaculture, our goal is simple - to make technology work for everyone, not just the big players. We build intelligent tools that automate the boring parts of work and help small and medium-scale industries visualize, plan, and execute better.

I started Formaculture with the belief that innovation should be accessible. Most MSMEs still rely on outdated methods, not because they lack ideas, but because the tools they need are too complex or too expensive. We are here to change that.

Every product we create is designed to save time, reduce manual effort, and give business owners clarity through smart automation and easy-to-use dashboards.

Formaculture is where creativity meets technology and where every idea takes form through culture.

Harsha leads the vision and design of Formaculture’s intelligent tools. With a background in AI and product innovation, he’s passionate about transforming how MSMEs work through accessible automation. Off the clock, he’s usually sketching ideas, exploring tech design trends, or brewing story concepts for his creative projects.

Culture overview
A belief - that technology should feel human. The same belief defines how we work together. We value curiosity more than credentials, initiative over instruction, and creativity over convention. Everyone here is encouraged to question, to experiment, to fail fast, and to learn faster. Our days aren’t defined by strict hierarchies or rigid titles. A designer can spark a product idea, an intern can challenge a workflow, and a developer can lead a brainstorm. What matters most is contribution and clarity of thought.
